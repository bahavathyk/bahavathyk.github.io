I am a PhD student at University College Dublin in the School of Computer Science. I am undertaking my PhD as part of the ML-Labs cohort based doctoral programme. My main research interest is in time series classification with a particular interest in sports and healthcare applications. 

### My research
Exercise data that is captured using inertial measurement units (IMU's can be used to train models to objectively classify motor performance. These models can then help to understand performance, diagnose injury, and monitor recovery of athletes. This data from the sensors tends to have many dimensions which can be correlated and noisy. My work looks at identifying useful features in the time series sensor data with a focus on generating explainable output. My work focuses on the development of a feature subset selection technique for multivariate time series and in the generation of explainable models for exercise data.

### When I'm not Working...
I like to read, play badminton, bake, or go on a nice long walk.
